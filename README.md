For the purposes of this skills test, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I suggest you run npm start and look at the app in development mode.  You could run npm build but that will take some extra setup.


Make sure you have node.js installed.  

run 
##### npm install 
to get all the dependencies
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the UNIT test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm test-a`

Launches the AUTOMATION tests runner powered by Cypress.
Once the test window is opened, click on the auto.js to execute the tests.

## Roman Numerals

The guide I found how to best convert a number to a roman numeral is [rapid tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/how-number-to-roman-numerals.html).  Rapid tables also has a calcualtor which I used for validation, [calculator](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/roman-numerals-converter.html?x1=&x2=1240)
